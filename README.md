Algia is my new plan for an evolutionary step from the old algebra packages I have expiremented with creating. This package will simply make it easier to keep data out of memory while still being well-able to perform operations on it algebraically, with closures of course.  **this might be a while**  but is planned to be a foundational package in the Chifi data ecosystem (tied in to other packages.)
