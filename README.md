`AlgebraFrames` provides several convenient *out-of-memory* data-structures for Julia. There are a few specific goals that this package hopes to achieve on the front of **out-of-memory** data. The goal of this package is to reduce memory usage when web-hosting or analyzing large swaths of data using *Relational Management* for a simplified end-user experience.
- **relational management** `AlgebraFrames` uses *indexing* to act as a *relational management* tool for computed data.
- **live-wrangled** data. Data is only brought into Julia at execution time.
- **mutated copies** of existing array take only 64-bits of memory.
- **extension ecosystem** like other base [chifi](https://github.com/ChifiSource) packages, `AlgebraFrames` comes with its own [Ecosystem](https://github.com/ChifiSource#algebra-frames)
